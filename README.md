# Python-Kiwilytics-Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **analyzing customer orders and product sales**. The workflow demonstrates reading data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), answering business questions, creating visualizations, and summarizing insights.

## Project Workflow
1. **Load Dataset:** Read the CSV file and inspect its structure.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.  
3. **Answer Key Questions:**  
   - Determine the dataset shape.  
   - Fill missing `unit_price` values and calculate total revenue.  
   - Identify the top-selling product by quantity.  
   - Identify the customer with the highest total spending.  
4. **Visualization:** Create charts and dashboards to illustrate trends in sales, quantities, and revenue.  
5. **Summary:** Present insights and key takeaways from the analysis.

## Key Features
- Load and inspect datasets  
- Handle missing values and perform data cleaning  
- Calculate metrics like total revenue, top-selling products, and highest-spending customers  
- Visualize trends and patterns with charts  
- Summarize findings clearly for business insights

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## How to Use
